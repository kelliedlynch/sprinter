# Sprinter
### A tool for timed writing sprints

Write X words in Y minutes, or else. Set your goal and your timer, and visual feedback tells you when you're going too slowly. Inspired by [Write or Die](https://writeordie.com/), which was an excellent tool that helped me write 12 novels, but sadly stopped working on my tablet and is no longer updated.
